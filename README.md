# Safe stack warehouse (F#)
It is a simple CRUD client-server app for adding warehouses and products based on SAFE Template. Frontend and Backend are written in F# and works on postgress database.

## SAFE Template
This template can be used to generate a full-stack web application using the [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/). It was created using the dotnet [SAFE Template](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-overview/). If you want to learn more about the template why not start with the [quick start](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/quickstart/) guide?

## Install pre-requisites
You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) 3.1 or higher.
* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) package manager.
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Starting the application
Before you run the project **for the first time only** you must install dotnet "local tools" with this command:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
dotnet fake build -t run
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

To run concurrently server and client tests in watch mode (run in a new terminal):

```bash
dotnet fake build -t runtests
```

Client tests are available under `http://localhost:8081` in your browser and server tests are running in watch mode in console.
